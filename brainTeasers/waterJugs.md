You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


I would fill up the three-quart jug and dump it into the five-quart jug twice, leaving one quart left in the three-quart jug. Then I would dump out the five quart jug, and put the remaing one quart from the three quart jug into it. Then I would refill the three quart jug, leaving me with 1 quart in the five-quart jug, and three in the three totaling up to four.
