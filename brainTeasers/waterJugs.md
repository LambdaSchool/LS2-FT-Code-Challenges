You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

I would come up fulling the 3/4, passing it into 5/4 and fulling  1/4 of 3/4 and throw in the 5/4 jug.

I would come up fulling the 5 quart one, emptyn 3 quart, fulling 5 one again, passing  the 5 full into the 3 4 and then we will get 4 / 4 on the 5 / 4.
