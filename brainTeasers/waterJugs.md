You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

 1. Fill up three-quart jug of water, make sure five-quart jug is empty.
 2. Fill up five-quart jug with the three quarts of water.
 3. Refill the three-quart jug with water.
 4. Fill up the five-quart jug until it is full, now there is one quart of
    water left in the three-quart jug.
 5. Empty the five-quart jug.
 6. Pour the three-quart jug with the one quart of water into the
    five-quart jug.
 7. Fill the three-quart jug with water.
 8. Pour the three-quart jug that is full into the five-quart jug and
    now the five-quart jug has four quarts of water in it.
