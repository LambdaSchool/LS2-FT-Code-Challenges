You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1. Fill up the 5 quart jug.
2. Use the water in the 5 quart jug to fill up the 3 quart jug. You will have 2 quarts left in the 5 quart jug.
3. Empty the 3 quart jug. You will have 2 quarts left in the 5 quart jug.
4. Pour the 2 quarts from the 5 quart jug into the 3 quart jug. You will have 2 quarts in the 3 quart jug.
5. Fill the 5 quart jug. Pour the 5 quart jug into the 3 quart jug. The 3 quart jug will have 3 quarts in it, and the 5 quart jug will be left with 4 quarts in it.
