You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.


// 1.  Fill up five-quart jug.
// 2. Use five-quart jug to fill up the three-quart jug.
// NOTE: Now you have two quarts of water in the five-quart jug and a filled
// three-quart jug.  Note where the water was filled up to in the two-quart jug.
// 3. Empty the three quart jug.
// 4. Pour the two quarts in the five-quart jug into the three-quart jug.
// Fill the five-quart jug up to the same level it was before (2-quarts).
// 5. Add the two quarts from the three-quart jug to have a total of four quarts
// within the five quart jug.
