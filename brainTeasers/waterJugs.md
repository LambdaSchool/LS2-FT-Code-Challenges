You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Fill the 5 quart jug
Pour 5 quart jug water into 3 quart jug so you are left with 2 quarts in the 5 quart
Empty 3 quart jug
Pour 2 quarts into the 3 quart jug
Fill 5 quart jug again
Pour 1 quart into 3 quart jug so you are left with 4 quarts in the 5 quart jug
