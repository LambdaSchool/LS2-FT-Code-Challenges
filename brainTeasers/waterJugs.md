You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

// 5-quart jub || 3-quart jug || unl water ? Get exactly 4-quarts

1. You would fill the 5-quart jug fully and pour it into the 3-quart jug. You would have a full 3-quart jug and a 5-quart jug with 2 quarts remaining in it.
2. The next thing to do is to empty the 3 quart jug of its contents and pour the remaining 2 quarts from the 5-quarts jug into the 3-quarts jug
    At this point, you will have 2 quarts in the 3-quart jug and 0 quarts in the 5-quart jug
3. Next, you will fill the 5-quart jug again, and then start emptying it into the 3-quart jug. Now because the 3-quart jug contains 2-quarts already,
    it will only need 1 quart to be full, leaving the 5-quart jug with exactly 4-quarts
